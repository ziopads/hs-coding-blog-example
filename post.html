                  <h1>Peregrines</h1>
                  <hr>
                  <p>I wasn’t there when the photograph was taken—an insignificant snapshot pulled off by his girlfriend, who was probably on her way to being drunk at the time. It was taken in Killarney, or maybe in Galway, and shows a diffuse, almost impressionistic image of him sawing away on his fiddle. There is the suggestive figuration of the bow playing across the strings—its precision too delicate to register as more than a blur—and the solidity, the stability, of the fiddle and the obscured figure holding it. And I’m startled by this composure and self-assurance, as if the picture tells a truth I had apprehended in substance, but not degree.</p>
                  <p>It is one of the metaphysical conceits of the peripatetic school, as we were both taught, that the essence of a thing is articulated in abstraction. The photo works on this Aristotelian principle; it is a snapshot of pure being, a moment of arrival. And it is disconcerting for me to look at this picture, because at the same time that there is a profound, private sense of pride in his achievement, I am a little envious. I nurse the suspicion that my send-off pushed him further than I anticipated, that he has leap-frogged over me and severed some fraternal thread. When one encounters such accomplishment one is inclined to forget the cost at which it was won—being eclipses becoming. He would laugh to hear this. He has always possessed a certain bright-eyed shyness, a reticence. A disregard for things too serious. I see him as he was as a choirboy in the Episcopal Church, ruffled and cassocked up beyond the rood screen, mouthing the words but not actually singing. We laugh about it still sometimes, and I am met with the same boyish, elliptical smile: that of a jokester from an early age, irreverently pulling one over on the austere Anglican authorities. True to his nature, he left me drowning in the pedantry of reduplicative Greek verbs and flew off to play his fiddle. Gignomai. Gignetai. But departure is prerequisite for becoming.</p>
                  <p>I’m astonished by how much is left out of the photo, the idiosyncrasies that have become so familiar: the unevenness of the front teeth, broken in half against concrete when he was a child, then capped and broken again, and recapped. And yet still, they’re somehow more perfect than my own. Or his eyelashes. Quite simply the longest, most eloquently graceful in existence. Observant women are jealous, those who know the seductive power of lashes, and somewhat afraid, because these eyelashes have something other-worldly, a seductiveness that goes beyond the gimmickry of mascara to express the teleological, animating pull of the spirit. They speak of the mystery of contentment.</p>
                  <p>Yet something is obvious. Wildness civilized by the natural proportions of its appetites. It is there in the hair, like straw, with patches growing in every direction. Incorrigible, but without any need to be tamed. The aspect is shared with his animals—two parakeets, cockeyed, sitting on his head, and two fish, one black and the other gold. And here is another iteration of departure: the goldfish were given baroque names, the result, I think, of an underhanded, self-deprecatory pride inspired by their billowing tails: “He Who Swims Under Abstruse Night” and “Golden One Jumping Over Flaming Rainbow.” Somehow, we managed to call them by their unpronounceable acronyms. When one died, he was sent off to sea in a burning longboat, constructed of cardboard over hours, complete with a sail. It’s a surprisingly moving ceremony. It takes place at dusk, and I find I don’t know which is more beautiful, the sight of glowing orange flames against the fading purple light of nightfall or the figure squatting on the shale ledges of the shore, standing vigil as the vessel, over the course of an hour, burns into the depths and completes the trajectory of a life.</p>
                  <p>He is measured with his words, and there is an imperturbability in his laughter, in his smile. His thoughts run like a stream that you can dip your hands into, but never hold. Occasionally, a bright flash of color will surprise you—some angry breed of fish, cutting through the water. There is a suddenness to his violence, in the unexpected moment of seeing him put his fist through a wall. And I wonder at what is concealed by the apparent serenity of water, what creature emerges in such parenthetical moments of rage. Until I realize that this, too, is part of the natural order.</p>
                  <p>I remember when he came back from an ornithological research trip to an uninhabited island. He was gone for months, and returned ripe with the experience of pulling yellow warblers from mist nets out on the island, forty miles off the coast of New Brunswick. He came back tan, rugged, and with the look in his eyes of one who had seen divinity unveiled. And I knew from what he said that it had been the moment when he held this small bird throbbing in his hand. In the scientific process of banding and measuring an animal he had experienced mortality, and it became like a secret understanding between us, something not to be spoken of. Ornithos. Ornithou. Belonging to the bird.</p>
                  <p>Peregrination is born of hunger, of thirst. He dropped out of school, like his brother. Went north to Columbia, Maine, to rake blueberries and harvest lumber to make enough money to go to Ireland and play in the pubs. He was pleasantly surprised to find that, being a musician, he was not expected to pay for his drink, and so was able to stretch his grubstake further. He called me shortly after he arrived, and sometimes I still hear the echo of that voice, lighter than I have ever heard it, with untempered enthusiasm. There is no mistaking the exuberance of an animal in its native habitat.</p>
                  <p>	It was not always so. He spent the summer with me before he left, sleeping most of the time, enervated, languishing in the heat and indecision. There was the vague notion of fiddling in Ireland, but he was uncommitted. He played distractedly, without conviction, sure of only the desire not to be where he was. Uncertainty overshadowed him, and I learned as I had never before that melancholy can render one opaque to the eyes of empathy.</p>
                  <p>	We were taught about such things, each in our own season, by a philosopher who set out to school us in ethics, beginning with Aristotle. He had come to his discipline as an Army intelligence officer during the Second World War, reading the German phenomenologists as part of his linguistic training. His understanding had been forged in extreme conditions of conflict; philosophy was the underlying order, and ultimately the hope, that subsumed the savagery of war. So we were grounded in the metaphysical mysteries—wherein “the what is” (ti esti) becomes “that which it was to be” (to ti en ennai)—in virtue, ratiocinative desire, and responsible choice. With rigor, but also with poetry. These principles were more than a defense against irrationality; they were the ultimate answer to it. But hearing the belief of another is not the same as recollecting the truth from your own marrow. </p>
                  <p>	And so there comes a time when one must leave the Lyceum and venture into the wilderness, across frontiers, to shiver at the foot of the numinous. It is an ordeal for which there is no such thing as adequate preparation; “one comes to all great events in one’s life a virgin.” I was the first to go. There is a humility that no philosophy can teach, that is learned only through experience. </p>
                  <p>	Finally, he made the choice. The first of two trips. In leaving, one always takes something from home, and I wanted to send him off with the benefit, literally, of my experience. So I returned my sleeping bag to L.L. Bean. I had lived in it for a year and a half and kept it in a stuff sack in a closet for another year. It was not the most scrupulous trade, but I was broke. For myself and the clerk at the counter, I justified the exchange with the memory of freezing nights in the Karakorams, and in this I recognize another difference: he would laugh at such rationalizations. For him, there is no indecision in these matters. This clarity is a luxury he has learned to afford even in circumstances of gravity; that he could afford it at the time was a sign of inexperience. I traded for a raincoat and a case knife. It couldn’t have been anything else, because everyone, even he himself, was blind to the urgency. Such was my gift. A skin and a knife.</p>
                  <p>	He lived there for a year and played. Narrowly, he skirted deportation by the Gardai. He had no use for returning, and though he had been persuaded to go back to school, he was still in Galway when the semester started, entangled in a woman. He eventually came back and shrugged his way through what was left of school, taking pleasure where he found it, distinguishing himself in the process. But the entire time he was waiting to go back, and within a month of graduating, he was gone. It was then, sometime after this return, with another woman, that the photo was taken. </p>
                  <p>Perhaps the spirit expresses itself by the geography it traverses. It is an unconscious language. He is only dimly aware of the refracted logic that finds him wandering on an island where peripatetic searching became the Catholic peregrinatio, which in turn became the peculiarly Irish institution of green martyrdom. Something in the battered coast continues to call mystics who find meaning in a pint of Smithwicks and playing of a reel. It is a particular balance between solitude and community, a monastic impulse that has survived and still fascinates some twelve centuries after monks abandoned the Skellig monastery. It is inevitable that he will return; the finding of wilderness, of one’s natural habitat, is an election made so deep in the core that it is obscure to us, beyond questioning.</p>
                  <p>And the actual leave-taking, what was it like? I find I can look at it only indirectly, by capturing the reflection of it in the memory of my own departure, when I walked with him a short way and told him there was a good chance I would never come back. Then I was faced with an uncanny serenity—part of it incomprehension, another part wisdom—cast in an inflection of the head and laughter like the murmuring of pigeons. There is something terrible in that interstitial moment where one is asked to account for and master oneself in the face of loss. And here I draw short, for the most painful truths are inscribed in disparities.</p>
                  <p>His is the harmony of existence yielding gracefully, honestly, to the necessity of what it most truly is. Innate and cultured, always inscrutable, the Cheshire smile and the lonesome touch. And as I turn it over in my head I reconsider and think that a photograph can perhaps capture something of the music of the spheres.</p>
