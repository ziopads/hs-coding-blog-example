Welcome.

This is a quick demo of project 2.

> Chrome

You can see that this is a basic blog and we have three main sections - header, main content area - which is split between blog posts and a side bar, and footer.

When you click the "Read More" link, it takes you to the full blog post. Then if you want to hop back to the main page, you can just click the blog link.

> Atom

Turning to the index.html page, like project 1, the code is contains comments and spaces that break apart the code so that it's easy to see each of the sections. Also, I used semantic HTML5 tags. I am also using the Bootstrap grid helper classes so that my page is responsive.

> Chrome

Jumping back to Chrome, you can see that the page not only looks good on a desktop but on iPhone as well.

> Atom

Nothing special happening in the CSS. Again, just divided it up to make it easier to revise and update.
